Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

What is Software Engineering?

Software engineering is a systematic process for designing, building, testing, and maintaining software programs. It applies principles from engineering to create software in a stable, expandable, and efficient way. Software engineering is crucial in the tech industry since it enables the creation of stable and user-friendly programs that power businesses, industries, and day-to-day digital interactions.

Major milestones in software engineering history

First Programming Languages (1950s to 1960s) - Some of the early languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and LISP formed a foundation for modern programming.

Introduction to Structured Programming (1970s) - Encouraged better code structuring and readability, reducing software complexity.

Agile Manifesto (2001) - Shift away from formal processes to flexible, incremental methods, improving responsiveness and capacity to adapt to changing environments.

Phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

System Requirement Analysis - Capturing and defining system requirements.

Design - Software architecture and design specification.

Implementation (Coding) - Creating the actual program from design specifications.

Testing - Making sure software functions correctly.

Deployment - Getting the software into use.

Maintenance - Updating and improving software following release.

Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies: Comparison

Waterfall: A linear process where one stage is completed before moving to the next. Ideal for projects with clearly defined specifications and stable requirements (e.g., government software projects).

Agile: A process that is flexible and evolves with real-time feedback. Ideal for dynamic projects like building a mobile app.

Roles within a software engineering team

Software Developer: Writes and modifies code, adds functionality and debugs.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software quality through rigorous testing and debugging.

Project Manager: Oversees project schedules, coordinates team members, and ensures business objectives.

The Importance of IDEs and VCS Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - Make code writing easier with syntax highlighting and debugging capabilities (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).

Version Control Systems (VCS) - Track changes and facilitate collaboration (e.g., Git, Subversion).

Shared Problems and Solutions in Software Engineering

Managing Technical Debt - Refactor code on a regular basis and use best practices.

Meeting Deadlines - Employ Agile methodologies for greater flexibility.

Adhere to software security best practices like code reviews and vulnerability testing.

Types of Software Testing

Unit Testing: Tests a single unit for accuracy.

Integration Testing: Tests interactions between integrated modules.

System Testing: Tests the overall system for functionality.

Acceptance Testing: Ensures software meets user requirements before deployment.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is a technique for designing and refining input prompts for effective communication with AI models. It maximizes AI response accuracy to deliver meaningful and relevant outputs.

Here is an example:
What are

Yes, I can tell you about history.

Give a short summary of the main events in World War II, highlighting important battles and political effects.

Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective?

Accuracy: States what is meant using specific words.

Focuses on important events rather than a broad historical scope.

Clarity: Tells the AI to provide a well-structured and relevant response.
